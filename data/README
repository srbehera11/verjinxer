This directory contains some example data. The idea is to use this as a test case for the
matching and indexing algorithms.

Please keep the files small, not only to save bandwidth, but to make debugging easier.


cpgislands.fa:
200 randomly chosen CpG islands (plus some context before and after) of the human genome.
Nucleotides written in lowercase denote repeats.

read120636.fa, cgi1.fa:
cgi1.fa contains a single CpG island. Starting from index 0, it contains
the read from read120636.fa, without any errors. (Only C->T replacements since
it is a bisulfite-modified read.)
