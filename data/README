This directory contains some example data. The idea is to use this as a test case for the
matching and indexing algorithms.

Please keep the files small, not only to save bandwidth, but to make debugging easier.


cpgislands.fa:
200 randomly chosen CpG islands (plus some context before and after) of the human genome.
Nucleotides written in lowercase denote repeats.

read120636.fa, cgi1.fa:
cgi1.fa contains a single CpG island. Starting from index 0, it contains
the read from read120636.fa, without any errors. (Only C->T replacements since
it is a bisulfite-modified read.)

colorspace.fa:
Test file for color-space conversion. This file is in regular 'nucleotide
space' (that is, its alphabet is ACGTN etc.)

colorspace.csfasta:
Test file for color-space conversion. This file is the colorspace-converted
version of colorspace.fa. The conversion was done like this:
 tr acgtnmMrR ACGTNNNNN < colorspace.fa > tmp.fa
 encodeFasta.py tmp.fa > colorspace.csfasta
where encodeFasta.py is a tool that is included in //Corona lite//
(available at http://solidsoftwaretools.com/gf/project/corona/). 

colorspace.seq:
The command
vji translate --colorspace colorspace.csfasta
should create a file that is exactly the same as this one.

It was created like this:
 vji tr -a colorspace.alphabet colorspace.csfasta

colorspace.alphabet:
Test file for color-space conversion. See above.
