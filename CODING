Coding style, other guidelines
==============================

The code should follow the official Java code conventions available at  
http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/ .

Each indentation level is three spaces.

If you work with Eclipse, use the eclipse-coding-style.xml (in this directory)
by importing it in Eclipse as follows: Go to Window -> Preferences -> Java ->
Code Style -> Formatter and then click "Import...".
