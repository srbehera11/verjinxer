To run VerJInxer, you need to have log4j and log5j in your CLASSPATH. Both jar files can be found in the lib/ directory. I use something like this to simplify things:

alias vji="java -ea -d64 -Xmx8G -cp $HOME/workspace/verjinxer/lib/log5j-1.2.jar:$HOME/workspace/verjinxer/lib/log4j-1.2.jar:$HOME/workspace/verjinxer/bin/ verjinxer.Main"

To work with sequence data, it must first be translated from FASTA
format.

	vji tr --dna refseq.fa
	vji tr --dna queries.fa

This creates projects 'refseq' and 'queries'. All further commands use
these names as parameter.

Create a q-gram index of a reference sequence

	vji qg refseq

Create a bisulfite q-gram index of a reference sequence

	vji qg --bisulfite refseq

Match queries against a q-gram index. Also works for a bisulfite q-gram index.

	vji qm queries refseq

Same with minimum match length of 25 and a filter:

	vji qm -l 25 -F 2:1 queries refseq

The filter is specified as "2:1", which means that all q-grams
are ignored for matching that consist of only two alphabet characters.
The one means that one additional character is allowed that is different.

Create a q-gram index of a query sequence

	vji qg queries

Match a reference sequence against a q-gram index of queries

	vji qm refseq queries

If the index contains bisulfite-treated sequences, then simulation of
bisulfite treatment of the reference sequence should be requested:

	vji qm --bisulfite refseq queries
